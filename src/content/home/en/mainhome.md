Passionate about IT from a young age, I discovered development in high school and began my career as a web developer after earning a DUT in Computer Science and a professional degree in IT.

As an experienced full-stack developer with over 5 years of expertise, I mainly worked on the development and maintenance of a Spring Boot / Angular application platform for EDF, integrating advanced features and adhering to high quality standards.

Over the years and alongside my development activities, I broadened my skills and became a project manager at AXOPEN. I managed the maintenance and evolution of IT solutions, combining technical expertise and project management (80% development / 15% project management / 5% coffee break).

Alongside my professional life, I am passionate about sports. Whether it's BMX, running, or skiing, I love outdoor and adrenaline sports!
