Passionate about IT from a young age, I discovered development in high school and began my career as a web developer after earning a DUT (University Technology Diploma) in Computer Science and a professional degree in IT.

As an experienced full-stack developer with 5 years of experience at AXOPEN, I work primarily on the development and maintenance of a Spring Boot/Angular application platform, integrating advanced features and adhering to high quality standards.

Over the years, I broadened my skills and became a project manager at AXOPEN, where I oversee the maintenance and development of IT solutions, combining technical expertise and project management.

Alongside my professional life, I'm passionate about sports. Whether it's BMX, running, or skiing, I love outdoor and adrenaline sports!
